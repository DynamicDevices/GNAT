## TTGO-T-Call on PlatformIO

NOTE: This is forked from https://github.com/nailsonlinux/TTGO-T-Call-PlatformIO which has a nice example of how to add the TTGO T-CALL custom board to Platform.io

Setting up a new project using an un-supported board on PlatformIO can be cumbersome.

To avoid wasting time, i`ve done that. You just need PlatformIO ans ESP32 installed. It compiles out-of-the-box.

The "secret" salsa is the boards dir.

Enjoy!
